		<p><b>How COVID-19 Affected San Francisco</b>: by Peter Cuddihy<br><br>San Francisco is a city that has a lot of inequality and disparity between its people. It has some of the richest people in the world, as well as a massive population of homeless people. <br>It also has a wide diversity of people across age, race, and neighborhood lines. The goal of this project is to show how those groups have been affected by COVID-19, to highlight the most affected groups.</p>
