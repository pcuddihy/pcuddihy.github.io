		<p><b>Overview:</b> My project is examining how COVID-19 has affected San Francisco. I am using data to show how different groups across San Francisco have been affected. <br>For my project, I am going to start with the most general level and get more specific as I go, showing what communities have been affected the most.<br><br><b>Completed Features:</b> So far, I have completed all of the bar charts in my project and have implemented them with tooltips that show more detail.<br></p>

		<p><b>Upcoming Milestones:</b> I plan on working on the line charts, which will include multiple tracking lines showing the amount of cases for each age group, race, and the whole city.<br><br><b>Roadblocks:</b> Nothing right now, though I am thinking about how to change my overall design and color choice to liven up the charts.</p>
